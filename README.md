## About me

 - Currently working at [Graphcore](https://www.graphcore.ai) in Bristol. We're making chips for AI. It's a cool place to be.
 - I'm still maintaining and improving the Python [bitstring](https://github.com/scott-griffiths/bitstring) package.
 - My new project is a bitwise format parsing and building library called [bitformat](https://github.com/scott-griffiths/bitformat). I'm aiming for a first alpha release later in 2024.
 - I've not got much else on GitHub except my quixotic idea of [a clock based on a Go board](http://scott-griffiths.github.io/go-clock/).
